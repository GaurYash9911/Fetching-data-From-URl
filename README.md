# Text Analysis Project README

## Overview

This project involves extracting data from a list of URLs stored in an Excel file, performing textual analysis on the content of these URLs, and computing specific variables as outlined in the "Text Analysis.docx" document. The computed results are then saved in an output Excel file, following the structure specified in "Output Data Structure.xlsx."

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Required Python libraries (install via `pip` as mentioned in the previous responses):
  - `pandas`
  - `openpyxl`
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `lxml`
  - `spacy` (with the `en_core_web_sm` model)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.

2. Prepare the input data:
   - Create an Excel file named `input.xlsx` with two columns: `URL_ID` and `URL`, where `URL_ID` is a unique identifier for each URL, and `URL` contains the URLs you want to analyze.
   - Ensure that you have the URLs in the desired format.

3. Run the Python script (`text_analysis.py`) to perform the analysis and generate the output:
   ```
   python text_analysis.py
   ```

4. After running the script, the computed variables will be saved in the `Output Data Structure.xlsx` file in the exact order specified in the "Output Data Structure.xlsx" document.

## Usage

- Replace the sample text in the `text` variable in the script with your actual text data, if you're using text data directly.
- Customize the code for HTML parsing and variable computation based on your specific requirements and the structure of the webpages you're analyzing.
- Ensure that the spaCy model (`en_core_web_sm`) is installed, and consider customizing the list of positive and negative words for sentiment analysis.

## Customization

- Modify the code to handle different HTML structures or data extraction requirements.
- Adjust the list of positive and negative words for sentiment analysis based on your domain or specific use case.
- Explore additional NLP libraries and techniques to enhance the analysis and computation of variables.
